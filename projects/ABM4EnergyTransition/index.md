## Agent-based Simulation of Transition Scenarios for regional Heating and Energy Transformation

---
Our energy system is undergoing rapid change. New technologies and opportunities such as electromobility, digitization, energy communities or low-temperature heating networks are entering the market, which must be reconciled with societal demands for greater sustainability and political commitments such as the Austrian heating strategy with the goal of decarbonizing the heat supply for buildings by 2040. This poses a high level of complexity for decision-makers in politics, energy supply and business. An energy-efficient and climate-friendly heat supply of the future now requires planned action, the modernization of the existing building stock, a sustainable orientation of new buildings, and the conversion of the heating and cooling supply to renewable energy sources. Not only will infrastructure and technology change, but the use of buildings will also be transformed by digitalization, and administrative as well as planning processes must do justice to this system complexity. In addition to the spatial dimension of energy supply and demand, increasing importance must also be attached to the social dimension of the energy transition in planning and decisionmaking processes. The behaviors and decision-making patterns of central actors (politics, public administration, planners, investors, energy supply companies, population), each with their own specific roles, needs and values, are highly relevant to planning in the context of heat and energy transition, but are, if at all, hardly considered in current processes. This combination and integration will be addressed in the planned project complementing existing (spatial) planning approaches and tools by essential elements.
