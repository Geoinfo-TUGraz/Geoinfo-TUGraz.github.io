# Improved assessment of forest fire susceptibility
## IGNITE
---
The moisture content of combustible soil material in forests is the critical element for estimating the risk of forest fires starting. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) currently used in Austria provides unsatisfactory results with regard to the prediction quality of forest fires. Within the scope of this project, the FWI is to be improved for the whole of Austria and the estimation of the risk of forest fires is to be optimized. The basis for this are i) in-situ measurements in different forest types, ii) ignition experiments in the center on the mountain, iii) the creation of a spatially high-resolution (100x100m²) vegetation index for the risk of forest fires developing, taking into account tree species, gaps, litter moisture and topography, and iv) the validation/reparameterization of the FWI using existing forest fire data, the empirical data obtained and causal machine learning approaches. Final products are a map of forest fire occurrence risk based on vegetation, an optimized FWI, and a new cumulative approach to forest fire risk assessment that will be made available to the general public via the ZAMG homepage.

Duration of the project: 01 April 2022 - 30 September 2024
