# Spatial Data Infrastructure for Indoor Manufacturing Environments: A Case Study at a Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 

---
The objective of the project is a (semi-) automated workflow that supports the migration of manufacturing data into a spatial database. The spatial database serves as basis for a spatial data infrastructure, serving a wide range of applications. The spatial data infrastructure is filled with a variety of heterogeneous spatial and non-spatial data present in the manufacturing company. These data are harmonized utilizing a spatial extract/transform/load (ETL) Tool, and finally distributed to various applications using standardized interfaces and services. 

Duration of the project: 15 November 2015 - 30 April 2016
