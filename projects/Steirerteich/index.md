# Steirerteich - Plugin "Geodata for modelling irrigation in agriculture" 

---
There is a common interest of society in forward-looking water-management planning which in an agricultural context contains present and future aspects of utilization. All cross-cutting issues affecting water itself and its complete function in the ecosystem have been mapped in various legal matters and rule sheets. The related geospatial data can be enumerated taxatively and are also available through different data providers. The project contractor is developing a digital information system that can take all the necessary geodata and feed it to a defined set of analyses.


Duration of the project: 18 September 2018 - 18 September 2019
