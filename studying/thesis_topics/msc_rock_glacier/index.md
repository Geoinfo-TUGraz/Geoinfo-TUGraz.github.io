# Linked Data enabled Spatial Data Infrastructure for Rock Glacier Monitoring

---
## Motivation
Rock glaciers are creep phenomena of mountain permafrost, responsible for extensive mass transport in alpine environments. They are composed of rock debris and ice and move downslope by force of gravity due to a combination of plastic deformation of the ice and internal sliding processes. Rock glacier can be found in all high mountain ranges of the Earth, but did receive less attention by researchers in comparison to ordinary glaciers. Nevertheless, rock glaciers could be regarded a as proxy for climate change, as their movement rate is depending on the temperature profile between the permafrost table and the main shear horizon at depth. Warmer permafrost results in a higher motion rate of rock glaciers, especially when the temperature is around 0°C. 
Rock glacier inventories have been developed for different regions of the world for decades, but the efforts were not coordinated in any formal way. As there are many new initiatives to monitor rock glaciers in a more harmonized way – due to climate change – there is a need for a coordinated strategy and standardization. 

This coordination and standardization effort results in a national/global rock glacier monitoring program that shall provide the following functionalities:
* Collection of rock glacier survey data
* Inventory of (spatial) data for rock glaciers (including relict rock glaciers)
  * Including their kinematics: a) changes in volume b) motion speed
* Integration of existing rock glacier inventories

## Objectives of this thesis
* Development of a conceptual datamodel for rock glaciers (involves spatial & non-spatial data). This can be done with the help of an ontology – of importance for the Linked Data approach. The approach shall encompass surveying data and data quality issues as well. This involves:
  * Analysis of the stakeholders and their requirements
  * Analysis of existing rock glacier inventories
  * Review of surveying data for rock glaciers
  * Review of approaches to describe rock glacier kinematics
* Development of a Linked Data enabled SDI for rock glaciers based on the conceptual model. This involves setting up a Linked Data endpoint including the inherent semantics (RDF Schema). Development of a strategy to integrate existing rock glacier inventories with Linked Data strategies.
* Integration of selected rock glacier test data sets, to prove the functionality of the prototype.

## Sequence of actions
* Development of an Exposé (approx. 7 pages), comprising of the following parts: introduction, relevant literature, objectives & research question, approach, expected results.
* Notification of the Dean of Studies.
* Development of the prototype and documentation (thesis), including: literature research, evaluation if stakeholder needs and requirements, development of the system, testing; 
* Publication at an international conference on GISc or in a journal (mandatory!).
